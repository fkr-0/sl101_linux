#+TITLE: Linux on ASUS SL101/EP102/EEE Pad Slider

-> grate kernel, currently [[https://github.com/clamor-s/linux/tree/sl101][there]].

Build current commit on ~sl101~ branch using docker:
#+begin_src shell
make build
make kernel
make enter # entering docker container
./make_tegra.sh
#+end_src
after compilation kernel as zImage with appended dtb resides in ~/data~ which is mounted in the host os.

the contained kernel could be flashed using e.g.

#+begin_src sh
adb push data/kernel-id/zImage_dtb /sdcard/
adb shell "dd if=/sdcard/zImage_dtb of=/dev/mmcblk0p9"
#+end_src

I am not quite sure whether the boot partition should actually be ~mmcblk0p4~ so better find out which partition you have to flash, first.

The kernel can power a rootbinded OS. Further details [[https://sourceforge.net/projects/tf101-linux-images/files/][here]] and [[https://github.com/antonialoytorrens/TF101-linux-images][here]].
